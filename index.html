            <h1>Computer virus</h1>
            <p>
            A computer virus is a type of computer program that, when executed, replicates itself by modifying other computer programs and inserting its own code. If this replication succeeds, the affected areas are then said to be "infected" with a computer virus, a metaphor derived from biological viruses.
            Computer viruses generally require a host program.</p>
